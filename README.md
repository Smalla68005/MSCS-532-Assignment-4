# MSCS-532-Assignment-4

## Overview
This assignment aims to solidify understanding of heap data structures, their implementation using
arrays, and their applications in sorting (Heapsort) and priority queue operations. It will analyze the
efficiency of these algorithms and explore their use in real-world scenarios.

### Heapsort Implementation  
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap Data Structure. The code can be found in HeapSortImplementation.py file.

### Priority Queue
Priority Queue is used in the simple task scheduling application. The priority is used to determine task scheduling, and the comparison operators (<) enable tasks to be sorted according to priority. In the provided simulation, tasks are scheduled based on their priority. Tasks with the lowest priority values are processed first. 

## Instructions on Running the program 
1. ### Heapsort Analysis
    - Navigate to CompareSorts.py file
    - Before running, make sure you have HeapSortImplementation.py file and CompareSorts.py file in the same directory.
    - Run this (CompareSorts.py) python script
    - Analysis report: Analysis of Heapsort.pdf
2. ### Priority Queue Analysis
    - Navigate to PriorityQueue.py.
    - Run the file.
